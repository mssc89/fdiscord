# FDiscord
Fortran library for Discord

Creating Discord bot in an ancient language was never that easy!
It uses features of modern 2008 Fortran, but file extensions are kept as .f90 for compatilibity's sake.
It's more of a wrapper of [Sleepy Discord](https://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord) than standalone library, so it needs automake and all of the Sleepy Discord depediencies.

# Why
Because, Fortran is fun and fast language, which needs some attention. Also, I was just bored.
